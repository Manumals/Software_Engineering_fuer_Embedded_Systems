	General:
		wrong includes in header.
			-> header should only include files if it need them for the declaration (most likely types like EventEnum)
		LineRecognitionModule missing
		extern keyword only on declaration not on definition
		only describe declaration
		wrong use of parameter/return comment -> only comment existing parameters and return values not void

	DriveToStart:
		States should not need knowledge of other states
			DriveToStart_GoToDriveToFinish
			
	SetParameter:
		static ParamSet gParamSetArray[]; does need a size
		missing definition of static functions
		declaration of static functions where definition should be
		Param Set should be defined under types in header
		
	DisplayCountdown:
		Description to specific. Application layer does not need to specify the display type. What if hardware changes to LCD display?

		wrong indentation
        Missing doxygen documentation

	SetParameters:

	General:
		why were the "speaking" names removed in favor of generic entry/do/exit functions that hide the actual functionality?
	SetParameters
		getCurrentParameterSet should not be part of this state since it has to be called when the state is not active
		
	DriveToStart:
		States should not need knowledge of other states
			DriveToStart_GoToDriveToFinish
	
	LineRecognition:
		no connection to lineSensor
        Also sounds like it would duplicate the functionality of lineSensor.
		
	DriveHandler:
		why the connection to EventEnum?
		why no connection to lineSensor? why do all drive states still have the connection to LineSensor?
		
	InitializeMcu:
		missing display connection
		
	ErrorHandlerState:
