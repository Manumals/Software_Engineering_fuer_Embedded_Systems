/** This defines the maximum text length for a temporarily used
 * string that is only used once in the upcoming code.
 * One would think that it would be okay to just define the string length
 * directly at the declaration of said string variable. And this would also be
 * really easy to read and understand, because the length would be written down
 * exactly at the point where it is used and not hundreds of lines of codes away
 * from that. But that is only what a very naive and inexperienced programmer would think.
 * Because than this would count as a magic number, a number that comes from nowhere
 * and is not explained anywhere, which is really bad! Generations of programmers
 * would come across this magic number and wonder why it has this exact value.
 * For most of them it would be an unsolveable riddle, some of them would most likely
 * go insane, wondering about this number until their deathbed, wheezing
 * "What does it mean!?" after taking their last breath. And this would just
 * lead to an endless loop of suffering. Their offspring would go on a journey
 * of revenge just to suffer the exact same fate.
 * This is the reason why this definition and the corresponding doxygen comment
 * is so vitally important for you, who is reading this, and mankind.
 * But the programmer who put a lot of thought into this knows precisely
 * why he choose the exact number down below and not a bit
 * more or less. And the good thing is, he is willing to share
 * this invaluable knowledge:
 * The programmer thought the hereby defined length would be enough to hold the
 * countdown */
